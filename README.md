These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)

   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some

# Git Learning Project

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing Git, the powerful version control system that helps developers manage code efficiently and collaborate effectively. Through this project, I will explore the fundamentals of Git, including version tracking, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

## Goals

By the end of this project, I aim to:

- Understand how to initialize a repository and track changes to files.
- Learn to stage, commit, and log changes effectively.
- Practice creating and managing branches for feature development.
- Resolve merge conflicts and understand rebase workflows.
- Collaborate using Git by simulating team scenarios (e.g., pull requests, forks, and cloning).
- Apply best practices for writing meaningful commit messages and organizing repositories.

## Skills Demonstrated

Upon completing this project, I will have demonstrated:

1. **Version Control Basics**: Understanding the core concepts of Git and its role in software development.
2. **Branching and Merging**: Proficiency in managing multiple branches and combining changes seamlessly.
3. **Collaboration Workflows**: Knowledge of Git workflows like GitFlow, feature branching, and contributing to open-source projects.
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Confidence in resolving merge conflicts and maintaining clean commit histories.
5. **Command Line Proficiency**: Increased familiarity with Git commands and the terminal interface.

## Self-Reflection

This README will also serve as a space to reflect on what Iâ€™ve learned once the project is complete, highlighting challenges I faced, how I overcame them, and any areas for future improvement.
