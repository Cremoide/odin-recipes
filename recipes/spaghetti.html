    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the
      classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect
      golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full
      flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
      <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
          the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm
          to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta
          bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold
          skillet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce
          heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir
          until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from
          heat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
          Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and
          half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
